Throughout the semester we will develop a speed camera algorithm consisting of the following features:
- [x] Vehicle detection with YOLO
- [ ] License plate localization
- [ ] License plate reading with optical character recognition (OCR)
- [ ] Vehicle speed measuring using optical flow

The students working on this project are:
- Pucsok Sándor (pucsoksandor)
- Kürti Ádám (Kurtiadam)
